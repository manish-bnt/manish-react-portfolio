          Hi, I’m Manish Basnet, a Frontend Developer who loves building clean
          and interactive websites. I specialize in React, JavaScript, and CSS
          to design engaging user interfaces. With over 3 years of experience
          working with these technologies, I’ve built projects such as a Todo
          List app, portfolio websites, and simple landing pages. I enjoy adding
          interactive features to web applications to make them more effective
          and user-friendly. When I’m not coding, you’ll often find me dancing
          or exploring games. I’m always open to collaborations and new
          opportunities — let’s connect!
